# Overview

#
# A table style contains configuration for a style of map table, which is shown when zoomed out to the paper map. (aka flat map)
#
# To add specific objects that are only shown for a specific map table style:
# - Create one or more object layers in `game/gfx/map/map_object_data/layers.txt`
# - Limit their visibility only for this table by specifying `visibility_tags = "{name_of_table_style}"`
# - Add any number of objects, add set their layer to be `layer = "{name_of_a_layer_you_just_created}"`
#
# Map Table Object shaders:
# - Objects that are below the paper map (table, chairs, floor, etc) should have one of the "standard_map_decoration" group of shaders.
# - Objects that are on top of the paper map (books, swords, etc) should have one of the normal "standard" group of shaders
#
# ( Otherwise they might not 'stack' correctly and block map names, or they might not cast shadows onto the map correctly. )
